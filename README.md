I've created this simple portfolio to help display some of my skills and to capture my growth to become a front-end dev.

This website was made with react + tailwind and it may look kinda basic right now, but I'll improve on it over time.

things to be edited:
1. Mobile homepage animation lag
2. Mobile homepage not aligned to the center
3. Add website title 
4. Update projects
